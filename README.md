# pet_share_project
A website where users could share their pets.

Initally the project started as a practice for Django and the steps that I needed to create a website but I decided to fully commit to this project as the idea
of sharing a pet sounded pretty awesome.

This explains why my actual project (test_dog) was named that way. I also geared this project towards dogs but then later I realized I could just open to a more general
topic of sharing pets.

Pet_share_project is one of my biggest projects so far allowing users to create private entries for their pets and then have option to share their entries
to the communities page.

This brought along some new ideas such as image uploads of their pets, a page where they could remove/edit their commmuntiy entries and, along with image uploads, a 
profile picture. I also explored Static and Media files for these images and when hosting on Heroku, I also got the chance to explore AWS S3 Buckets to serve
user's photos.

There are quite a lot of things I learned from this project such as useless commits/pushs, how to use seperate branches to work, secret keys and evironmental variables,
and more importantly my lack of organization skills.
